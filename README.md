**Enhancements**

Artifact used: 
The artifact used for all three enhancements is the Travlr GetAways web application, which was developed in February of 2024. The web application was developed in a previous project and while the web application met all of the requirements for the project, it was still far away from meeting the client requirements. Once the web page is fully completed, admins should be able to use CRUD methods to add, edit, and delete trips, rooms, meals, and more from the admin facing page and those changes should be reflected on the customer facing page. Additionally, login, registration, and checkout features should be implemented on the customer facing web page as well.  Prior to any enhancements the web application has an admin page and a customer facing web page with the only edit-able item being trips. Admins can login and add, edit, or delete a trip and those changes are reflected in the database and on the customer facing web application. For more information on functionality and code prior to enhancements please review the code review or software design document included in this repository.
