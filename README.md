 # Education
 
 My educational journey has proven to be an invaluable asset both professionally and personally. I've been studying computer sciences for just around 4 years now and have developed a set of skills that will allow me to be an asset to any company that I work with. My first two years of college were completed in a traditional environment at the University of Pulaski Technical College, where I gained my associate degree in computer science and information technology in 2022. My time at Pulaski Tech was spent learning basic and foundational computer science knowledge that ultimately allowed me to confidently enter the workforce as an information technology specialist while I worked to remotely earn my bachelor’s degree of Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Remote learning has it’s own sets of challenges as a majority of the courses are self-taught with materials and feedback provided by instructors along the way. However, the motivation, grit and determination it took to complete my bachelor’s degree in such an unconventional setting will remain with me for a lifetime. I will use that some motivation and inspiration to guide myself through any hurdle thrown my way in both my professional and personal life. The confidence I have gained in myself to tackle any obstacle that comes way and to overcome any challenge is the most valuable asset I have gained throughout my educational journey. I have found my passion and I have found what I am good at.

<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to say that I do good work because I love what I do, and SNHU has paved the way to me finding that passion.

* Problem Solving skills  
* Attention to detail  
* Self driven and self motivated

[CS-255 System Analysis and Design](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/DriverPass), Software Development Lifestyle CS-250, and [Operating Platforms CS-230](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/Draw_It_Or_Lose_It) covered important skills related to the ability to effectively communicate with a team and with stakeholders while developing a project. Throughout these courses I gained knowledge on the Software Development LifeCycle, working in an AGILE environment, communicating technical aspects to team members and to stakeholders, and how to use industry appropriate tools to document relevant updates and milestones. The code review and Software design document included in this portfolio are excellent examples of the knowledge I have gained in these courses. Ultimately these courses allowed me to master the ability to effectively collaborate in a team environment and communicate with stakeholders, which are invaluable skills in the computer science field.
<br/>
<br/>


CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms provided the fundamental skills needed to use and implement basic data structures and algorithms. Arrays, Vectors, Linked lists, maps , trees, graphs were all covered in this course and put to use in later courses such as [IT-140 (Introduction to Scripting) where I created a [Text-Based Game](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/Text-Based-Python-Game) coded in Python that utilized maps and linked lists, in Client-Server Development CS340 where I created an [Interactive Dashboard](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/Client_Server_Development_CS340) using Python and MongoDB, and in CS350 Emerging Trends in Computer Science where I used my data structure and algorithm knowledge to implement a deep Q-learning algorithm to create an [AI based "Treasure-hunt" game](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/Pirate-Treasure-Hunting-Game).
<br/>
<br/>

My knowledge of software engineering and design began at Pulaski Technical college where I gained my Associates Degree in computer science before transferring to SNHU to work towards my Bachelor's Degree. At Pulaski Technical college I learned all about the four coding paradigms : functional, imperative, logical and object oriented (OOP) and basic coding principles and best practices.  Those skills were incredibly useful once I transferred to SNHU and was able to implement and expand my knowledge in software engineering and obtain newfound  and vital knowledge in databases and security.
In Foundation in Application Development CS145 - I applied problem solving techniques as I delved into learning Java , in CS-360 Mobile Architect and programming  I used my experience with Java along with Android Studios to develop a mobile inventory application , IT-140 Introduction to Scripting was a monumental course where I dove into Python and scripting as I developed the text-based game mentioned earlier , CS-210 Programming Languages was where I was able to advance my experience with C++ and OOP , [DAD-220 Introduction to Structured Database Environments](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/Databases-DAD220-) is where I was introduced to SQL and was later able to implement that knowledge professionally to write queries to pull specific information from local databases , [CS-305 Software Security](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/ArtemisFinancial) and CS-320 Software Test, Automation &QA provided invaluable insight as I learned to develop code with a security mindset in place and learned best practices and techniques for testing my software , and finally CS465 Full Stack Development which is where I found my passion for web development and where I developed the artifact used in the enhancements discussed below.
<br/>
<br/>
Every course at SNHU provided rewarding and lasting knowledge that helped to shape my education as a whole. Additionally all courses required communication and/or colloboration with peers through weekly discussion posts. Communicating with my peers on a weekly basis has allowed me to learn to communicate in a clear and efficient manner to both technical and non-technical peoples. I can not speak highly enough of my educational experience at SNHU.

# Illustration of Skills 
<br/>

To showcase my skills, I enhanced a previously developed artifact in three different categories. Those categories are Software engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Database enhancements. Please read below to learn about the artifact in it's orignal state and how I was able to enhance the artifact in each category. 
<br/>
**Artifact used in this repo:**
The artifact used in this repository and for all three enhancements is the Travlr GetAways web application, which I developed in February of 2024. Travlr GetAways is a ficticous travel booking company who was wanting to expand their services by implementing a customer and admin facing web application. The web application was developed using MEAN stack development procedures in a previous project and while the web application met all of the requirements for the project at the time, it was still far away from meeting the client requirements. Once the web page is fully completed, admins should be able to use CRUD methods to add, edit, and delete trips, rooms, meals, and more from the admin facing page and those changes should be reflected on the customer facing page. Additionally, login, registration, and checkout features should be implemented on the customer facing web page as well.  Prior to any enhancements the web application has an admin page and a customer facing web page with the only edit-able item being trips. Admins can login and add, edit, or delete a trip and those changes are reflected in the database and on the customer facing web application. For more information on functionality and code prior to enhancements please review the [**CODE REVIEW**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WlSppAobVI) or my [**SOFTWARE DESIGN DOCUMENT**](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FJessicaDuft%2FCS499-Capstone%2Fmain%2FCS%2520465%2520Software%2520Design%2520Document%2520V%25203.0%2520(FINAL).docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)
