**Artifact used in this repo:**
The artifact used in this repository and for all three enhancements is the Travlr GetAways web application, which I developed in February of 2024. Travlr GetAways is a ficticous travel booking company who was wanting to expand their services by implementing a customer and admin facing web application. The web application was developed using MEAN stack development procedures in a previous project and while the web application met all of the requirements for the project at the time, it was still far away from meeting the client requirements. Once the web page is fully completed, admins should be able to use CRUD methods to add, edit, and delete trips, rooms, meals, and more from the admin facing page and those changes should be reflected on the customer facing page. Additionally, login, registration, and checkout features should be implemented on the customer facing web page as well.  Prior to any enhancements the web application has an admin page and a customer facing web page with the only edit-able item being trips. Admins can login and add, edit, or delete a trip and those changes are reflected in the database and on the customer facing web application.
